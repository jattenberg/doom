"Rainbows"

You know, you best to watch out
'Til you, be fresh out of clout
Rumors that he got a mouth on the street
You know, you best to watch out
Who knows, who is watchin' in
Watch your back nigga
Fresh water trout
Out of water
Somebody tell him yo
Watch your back nigga
Streets is watchin'
Hope, they don't know (they don't know nothin)
As much he thinks, they know
That what, he drinks, Drano
Rat but, she winks, rainbows
Loser, was twice in the fed
User, whose nice in the head
Choose to, entice him with bread
Air him, they said he was
Ex-pen-dable
Air him, there's no witnesses
Dare him, they said he was
Ex-pen-dable
Air him, there's no witnesses
You know, you best to watch out
Who knows, who is watchin in
Comin' home son
Where that shit at bitch
Get paid son
Dead him dunn

Handle your B-I
Dead 'em dunn

Handle your B-I
Watch your back nigga
Nosey yo
Hope, they don't know (they don't know nothin')
As much he thinks, they know
That what, he drinks, Drano
Rat but, she winks, rainbows
This Villain was a ruthless mass conquerer
With aspirations to dominate the universe
