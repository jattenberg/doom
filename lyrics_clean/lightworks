"Lightworks"

What is the magic
That makes one's eyes
Sparkle and gleam, light up the skies?
The name of the game is lightworks
"I see you're peein' in your pants, little sissy boy!"
Jerks
Welcome to the octagon
Lay a playa flat before the trainer felt his clock was on
Keep your socks torn, it's a box-a-thon
With hard rock, Black, Rock & Ron's gone babazon
Curled up, beggin, layin on the canvas
Instead'a in a ready position like praying mantis
Scissors, hand this, grand fist sandwich
Stand switch, slammed on stitches which hands itch
Damn snitch
Any street corner
Could be the platform til he defeat gone and wonder
Watch ya mouth, jaw south paw, house floor
Doubt ya clout more, bout raw, out score, boa!
Off the leash like UFC
Off the beat, off ya feet like two lefties
FUB's, heffer please
Lost a few to stew beef, new referees
What a remarkable team, show ya teeth
The shine that sparkles and gleams
light up the signs
the name of the game is the lightworks
Light up the spliffs
the name of the game is lightworks
Wipe off slight smirks
The match was mapped out
Get jabbed and crap slapped out, tapped out
Either the lunchbin or joke whole time
Munchkins get punched in like vocal rhyme
The right hurts
