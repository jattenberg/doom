"Gazzillion Ear"

Villain man never ran with krills in his hand and
Won't stop rockin til he clocked in a gazzillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Rap sold backs of treasure maps stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask em after ten miles of his goulashes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed ta know. It show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough it's horrible
Time is money spend, waste, save, invest to fess
From ten case a cave with chicken chest S
Yes ya'll but don't forget your trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But tut tut, he about to change the price again
It go up each time, he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, havin' one thrilling affair
It won't stop, top illin' til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah ya boy had drama
Got em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold a inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand new chrome smokin' with the triggers broke
I thought I told em firing pins was separate
He find out later when he tries to go an rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance, translate it and ignored it sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughta
A junkie want ta cop a quarter ton, run for the border
Know the drill, it ain't worth the overkill
Flow skill, still... there's no thrill
Villain burn ya 10K bills in his villa
Villa, when it gets realer, split the skrilla with...
Dilla, (Dilla) mix, mix, mix
Do a deal for kicks and get rich quick
Sketch lyric, bet 'cha bottom nick on some vic
Ick from the drumstick, come with the dumb stick
Sick slick, hid in a book
The only way they find it if it's spittin in a hook
Listen, don't look now, keep walkin'
Traded three beans for this cow, cheap talkin'
Hawk men, stalkin', hit a weed, hawkin' often
Cough into a coffin, might as well scoff the pork then
He's like Wharf, some say stronger though
Off the top J strong bow, play along bro
Wear a mask like yo off the Gong Show
Flow slow as Mongo, Don Juan thong pro
For ya info when he's not practicin' Jim Crow
A actress and some nympho bimbo
He's playin' Ray Jay the old tape
DOOM, well what can I say like JJ in a gold cape
Fill it to the rim like brim
Villain and ya won't find him in no gym
Probably a foggy bog with the frogs
With a dot on the guard as he squat on log
Half cocked and half baked
Used to keep a full stock of work half rocked and half shaked
My mistake, silent track agreement
For more G's than lines and cracks in the cement
In any event it's fake like wrestlin'
Get em like Keak da Sneak on mescaline
Ahem, elixir for the dry throat
Tried to hit the high note. Villain's just a itsy bitsy zygote
By remote, send in the meat wagon
Braggin' MC's packed in with they feets draggin'
These stats are staggerin'
Had his PHD in indiscreet street hagglin'
Villain, his agenda is clear
Endin' this year with dividends to spare, here
It's not meant for the scene
Went through the celin' after enterin' his center bein'
A new meanin' to sales through the roof
Guaranteed raw and saw his truth is truth, proof
It's the return of the tramp
Who'll do a duet jam with Earnest Goes to Camp
For the right earn - knaa'mean like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn
Jiminy crickets, he gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off simply lyrics
One mans waste is another mans soap
Sons fan base, know the brotha man's dope
A real weirdo, with a bug rear flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerous
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the figure'ish
Black licorice is equally as yucky
How he handle the money was strictly Dan Stucky
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the hadron collider
And cost more, if it's seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile, ding!
Sparkling jewels, in effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach is never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head. Instead..
It was depicted as Flik did
Split, the wick's lit
