"Operation Lifesaver Aka Mint Test"

The world is under attack at this very moment by the most powerful forces man has ever seen.
Fate from the depths of the earth, Operation Lifesaver is in effect, as of right now
Wow, it caught me off guard
Went to breathe out and
Then she made me cough hard
Contact the god and let him know to slip 2 in
Fine. How are you doing?
Can I get you a drink?
This one's a shoo-in
Awkward situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
Her big butt and smile was like camo
Hit up the men's room, we need more ammo (reload)
Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit
That's her gin and Juicy Juice
Use a stick of Juicy Fruit (fire in the hole)
She just knew she was cute
It's in her own best interest
It's less stress
Hit her with the "do you need a mint" test
It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress
I won't rest
Fella's don't fess
Some of 'em just need to eat the whole thing of Crest (it's in effect)
It's been a long day (Operation Lifesaver is in effect, as of right now)
It's just how the song say
I hope she don't take this the wrong way
You need a mint bitch
