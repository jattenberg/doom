"Hardcore Hustle"
(feat. Wildchild)

(Madvillain...)
Jump on the track with a hardcore hustle
With a busload a niggas this time we bought 'cha muscle
Wildchild's the one to uplift most and it's confirmed
So tonight let's bang this Madvillain music 'till it's adjourned
Loot rushes in head first with the full force of a ram
So the source of the verse coerce the course of a jam
Went to hell and back, saw devil sellin' crack
In fact had to come back with brother with the mask
By yellin' "black.. power to the people", who support raw music
Blessed from the start to keep upliftin' progressive art
To come out and uplift words
Take verbalistic leaps to the next purge[?] compact dope poetical excerpts
Who's the expert (Wild)? With the physical frame
Who's mental was tamed to get over in this musical game
When the Madvillain breaks your dome you'll see
Your interval depth was written for those that slept
We take 100% unpredictable steps
(Say what?) Who's the one that rocked up a party with the vigilance urge
And just when ya got, caught up in the cynical thought
Intervals in the shape of a mic get put straight through your heart like..
