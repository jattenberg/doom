"Absolutely"

Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the villain surrounded then (AHEM!)
Good to the last drop nigglets
Hood til the blast pop them bigot-ass piglets
Go for the bosses, d*cks are higher
Beat walkers still get caught up in the crossfire
Get at the sarge, he give the orders
The rest of them punks'll quit the force or get slaughtered
Use stealth play, alleys, jet
We'd rather not alert them nosey federallies yet
Keep the local random cases in each state
Escape to the beaches for the season and be straight
You on call, keep your nikes on tight, no white
Anybody tell, get lighted on sight
The ring is on a need to know basis
No persons, places, things and no faces
Get bagged, you on your own, act it alone
Back home, your fam'll be provided fo' while you're gone
It's a price on all snitches
If you nice bring back eyes, fingers, toes an' pictures
Send copies to those who singin' the blues
Mothers an' fathers who's unjustly accused
Our species is in danger
Wear gloves an' strike in a city where you a stranger
That'll let them fools know
And send 'em a message, let them P.O.W.'s go
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Now you have your orders, do your duty
A new way to let the shots spray
A few drops a day, double expresso, d.a. latte
No smell, nor taste, hardly traceable
Wait to waste a prosecutor, paid to get the case pulled
Learn 'em a lesson for givin' bros mad stressins
A long list of CEO's names and addresses
A fake judge with many years on the bench
And sent some good cats to the chair, was aired in a trench
They say her tongue was teared out, smeared and drenched
The whole system's scared and doubtin' a fair stench
And she was tortured, some say post-mortem
The suspect took his own life before they caught 'im
It's real spooky like a real trife movie
Remember the part when terminator killed tookey
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
If they get the villain surrounded, son, then shitâ€¦
Shed blood, some'll be shooken
Just look with they head in the mud
Red flood
VILLIAN!
