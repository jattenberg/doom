"Coming For You"
(with Bishop Nehru)

Uh yeah yeah...
I said Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
Yeah Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
I said Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
Yeah Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
Not from a golden state but still a self-proclaimed warrior
Waiting for more euphoria, glory and all sorts of fun
Getting done more work than most ever do
My passion it pulls me through, so spitting writtens is food
That means it's easy to do, so while it may bring a smile to you
Don't be surprised if you see me try different routes
Without leaving my roots, I'll always see the booth
And always be the truth, so don't believe in the spoofs
Cause soon they'll be gone, no denying it
Replying with dope tracks and know I've been supplying this
"Your highness" is what I'm aiming for, Mr. Emperor
Spitting wicked words but remember the tongue is a sword
Uh, I swear to God I'm getting bored
So just wait and see what I have in store, it's the Emperor
Nehru
Sick and tired of being fooled
Living my life through your rules
I can't be a mule, I was born as a jewel
So watch what I'ma do, watch what I'ma do
I said Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
Yeah Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
I said Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
Yeah Emperor Nehru, we're coming for you
It's the underrated, underpaid but still most amazin'
Teenager making music since the cavemen
Feeling caved-in, my vision is getting tainted
Still awaiting the fan base I'm chasing
And to Phil Banks it, you judge me
You can leave me be immediately
I need mine seriously
At least until I get a name and then I can hang
But until then I'm saving a refrain
From cliques like a white-out, know I'm 'bout
To take off, no DeLorean
It's back to the future and there's no more ignoring him
Bishop here to make you hiccup and your heart skip a beat
Heâ€™s too deep, like steep drops, so he got a long way to go
But the motion ain't slow, so know he bound to blow
Like lighters at the gas station
I never pumped on the regular, is that why y'all hating?

I can't be a mule, I was born as a jewel
So watch what I'ma do, watch what I'ma do
