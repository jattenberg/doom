"Batty Boyz"

Oh shoot, get a load of that fruit
In thigh high boots, red tighty-whities and blue cat suit (Holy Homos)
Even the rats know it's tacky
"You ever see me slipping like that bitch just smack me"
Posing Chester, legs open, couldn't stand worse
All was missing was a bandana and a man purse
Crying, dying laughing till glands burst
Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding ass ran first
Fixing baby hair, messed up wavy curl
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people'll do for fame
It's a herb, it's a lame, It's… a god damn shame
Villain willing when them cold streets call
You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty
He work harder than a steam engine like John Henry
Turn dirt to dollars like Don Henley
Ugly and still get hollers like Ron Jeremy
At least monetarily terribly
MCs need therapy, it's like a faris? spree
Hit him with a kryptonite brick (kryptonite)
Children come and prick his dead body with a stick
Wrote this lyric from in the bed with a chick
She had the tightest grip around the head of moi…
Bic, now can I get my pen back
Got no enemy, got no friend, black
With the Green Goblin got the batcave robbed
Bust in Batman's head bobbin', slobbin' Robbin's knob
Y'all already got your belts on the floor so
Kick them shits over here and click off the porno
Alfred come home and found them both necked
Handcuffed to each other just as he had suspected
Red and chrome batmobile, wheelin' and dealin'
Aqua mans sleeping with the fishes, for real for squealin'
Pss the lo-lo on a seal skin blazer
It's just a little graze from a razor-thin laser
Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players
Showing off they tip offs to all the free-gayers
It's like a leotard fest
How it got started is any retard's guess
Regardless, that's they choice, no hate debate
Becomes a problem when they try an attempt to go straight
And raise the monster rate in the whole population
It's starting to affect the super pimpin' occupation
Now, who's the hater, headline the newspaper
Fate of a fake you out caped crusader
Tied to the tracks, make a damn tram derail
Rap is like scam spam Nigerian e-mail
The man with no beard is more weirder than a she-male
Sucker got bagged on a Temazepam street sale
Told 'em one of ours set it up, yeah doubt
Did it like the dirty drawls
Wet 'em up and air it out
