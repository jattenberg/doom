"Retarded Fren"

An honest day's work for an honest day's pay
Stay taking wages the anonymous way
Calmish
Pay to the Amish selling
Promise me gold brawn, palm itch swelling
With no "tack", tho
Ipso facto
Wondering in pictures why his lips is so black, yo!
No question
An ounce of prevention
Is more than a pound of raw cure pure intention
Attention!
No throwing stones at the homeless
Or else ye' yourself may end up with your dome blessed
Chrome dust, nano-sized particles
Stop telling codes through the YouTube, retarded fools!
Defeats the purpose
Greedily slurp up the surplus
And burnt puss
And so nervous, you can shirt must gush
Hush, hush. Trust
Villain til' the Earth crust bust
Self-defense, think he's not real
Up until you blink twice and feel the hot steel
Take it how you want it
Fake it or flaunt it
Need to put some brakes on it
Shake it, dog-gone it!
Dead drop
Leave it right there
Chop it off, heads bop
Breath it like the air
You hear?
Study the devil
Played the game and choose to deuce her on a bloody level
Who sent him?
Steady losing momentum
Ol' who'll eat a rapper one-a-day like Centrum
The mask is like a Gundam, dumb-dumb um
And don't matter where you come from, you bum!
What happens when the poles shift?
Won't matter for shit. Who you roll with?
Cold and stiff
Hold the if
If incase you need a facelift
Sold a gift
Rip it like space time foam, fold the rift
The sun still shines in the morning
He ain't promised you more, but it's definitely scorching
Like an iceball, off guard, soft, hard
Ask him do he give an F like report card
Out-spit em' like Jona
Add bonuses, intel suggests they had no cojoneses
On this microphone business, it's slaughter
That's on his 3 pre-mature daughters aortas
The thoughts was a quarters, halfs, wholes
A roll
And good times sold like good dimes
It's just begun to began to begin
To end, to start back again for smarter men and women
And their forgotten retarded Fren
