"Impostas"
(feat. MF Grimm)

The supervillain versus the golddigger
Doom mild mannered old nigga
Supporter for the daily blues
Reporter for the jewel drop news pop israeli tools
The world renowned master of word game
Who lay low sometime behind iceberg nerd frames
Yo M.F., they heard the name
But just couldn't quite place the rep if they retrace they step
Next EP., who to give thanks ta
Here lies the pranksta, tried to test a gangsta
The last thing he saw was a potato
From the lone nato who host his own late show
Keep a low lab on monsta island like seinfeld
White wine clientele connected like mindmeld
I can tell they see they styles as too tricky
And too thicky on this microphone doohickey
MF Monday through Friday get money
Saturday through Sunday, brown Al Bunday
Waitin for this shit to kick in as the plot thicken
He wrote these rhymes in 3-D with red and blue BIC pen
And to the chickens only hoes who say “let me hold em"
Take him in they mouth while he semi swollen, semicolon
I told him birds would do a nigga brutal for not using his noodle
F up and get bamboozled
He was the one to open to her up, blow her brains back
Dope her up or rope her to the train tracks
Or he would choke her til she collapse
Still he’ll poke her with the wood and tell her be good
He could take a phrase like Peter Piper picked a pepper
And put it where he couldn't peep the sniper, sicker repper
Nigga popper, stick a chick proper
Double platinum Oprah soap opera watchers gossipers on top of her
I keep forgettin can’t go raw anymore
I keep forgettin rappers is impostas
Been a show stopper since a ho hoppa
Never came second place in a neck and neck race
To the naked face who wanna battle bring the neck brace
We supply the insult to injury
Whoever in the industry getting money is too stingy
Violate, you might as well smoke me loc
Relocate Migrate or get caught with the okey doke
It's guaranteed ya last step
Step to me with the uzi
Watch that first step it's a doozy
Time flies as the hour glass trickles sand
One last thing before I blao this popsicle stand
A rolling stone and that's that at home
On the microphone like that's where he laid his hat at
I keep forgettin (keep makin dough)
I keep forgettin (mad flow MF metalface ho's)
I keep forgettin (actual stacks of shows)
I keep forgettin (worldwide 'cross the globe let the beat ride)
